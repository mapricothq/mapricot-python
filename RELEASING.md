# Releasing

Bump the version in `src/mapricot/__init__.py` (`__version__`), following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), and merge it to `main`. When the new version, such as `0.2.0`, has no tag yet, the release workflow runs the live tests, builds, publishes to PyPI, and creates the GitHub release `v0.2.0`. Merges that don't change the version release nothing.

If the release workflow fails, fix the cause and re-run it from the Actions tab.

## Keeping up with the API

CI runs every Monday as well as on each push. Its `endpoints` job fails when [the API's OpenAPI description](https://api.mapricot.com/openapi.json) lists an endpoint this client has no method for, and its tests fail when a live response changes. Add or fix the method and its test, and release a new minor version. A new endpoint is added to every Mapricot SDK at the same time.

## One-time setup

- A repository secret or organization secret `MAPRICOT_KEY`: a server key with the `places`, `routing`, and `ip-geolocation` scopes and a monthly cap, used by the live tests.
- A `release` environment in this repository.
- On pypi.org, a pending trusted publisher for the `mapricot` project: this repository, workflow `release.yml`, environment `release`.
