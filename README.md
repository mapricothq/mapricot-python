# Mapricot for Python

The official Python client for the [Mapricot API](https://mapricot.com/): address and place search, reverse geocoding, nearby places, routing, and IP geolocation, with 250,000 free requests every month.

```sh
pip install mapricot
```

It needs Python 3.11 or later and has no dependencies.

## Quick start

Create a server key in the [dashboard](https://app.mapricot.com/) and pass it to the client. Keep it out of your source code, for example by reading it from an environment variable as here.

```python
import os

from mapricot import Mapricot

client = Mapricot(os.environ["MAPRICOT_KEY"])

data = client.geocoding.search("128 SW 3rd Ave, Portland", limit=1)
place = data["results"][0]
print(place["label"], place["lat"], place["lon"])
```

## Methods

Methods are grouped by product, the same way as the API's paths. Each returns the API's JSON as a typed dict, with the same field names as the [API reference](https://mapricot.com/api-reference/).

| Method | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| `client.geocoding.search(q, focus=, country=, limit=, lang=)` | [`GET /geocoding/v1/search`](https://mapricot.com/docs/geocoding/#find-an-address) |
| `client.geocoding.autocomplete(q, focus=, country=, limit=, lang=)` | [`GET /geocoding/v1/autocomplete`](https://mapricot.com/docs/geocoding/#suggest-as-people-type) |
| `client.geocoding.reverse(lat, lon, limit=, lang=)` | [`GET /geocoding/v1/reverse`](https://mapricot.com/docs/geocoding/#find-the-address-at-a-point) |
| `client.places.nearby(lat, lon, category=, radius=, limit=, lang=)` | [`GET /places/v1/nearby`](https://mapricot.com/docs/places/#list-places-around-a-point) |
| `client.places.get(id, lang=)` | [`GET /places/v1/{id}`](https://mapricot.com/docs/places/#look-up-a-saved-place) |
| `client.routing.route(waypoints, mode=, geometries=, steps=, lang=)` | [`POST /routing/v1/route`](https://mapricot.com/docs/routing/#get-a-route) |
| `client.routing.isochrone(location, minutes, mode=)` | [`POST /routing/v1/isochrone`](https://mapricot.com/docs/routing/#get-an-isochrone) |
| `client.ip_geolocation.lookup(ip)` | [`GET /ip-geolocation/v1/{ip}`](https://mapricot.com/docs/ip-geolocation/#look-up-an-address) |
| `client.account()` | `GET /account`, which checks a key and is never billed |

`focus` and each waypoint are `{"lat": …, "lon": …}`. `country` and `category` take a list or a comma-separated string.

```python
nearby = client.places.nearby(45.52, -122.68, category=["food:coffee_shop"], radius=1000)
route = client.routing.route([{"lat": 45.5189, "lon": -122.6793}, {"lat": 45.5214, "lon": -122.6828}], mode="walk")
print(route["routes"][0]["durationSeconds"])
```

A route's path comes as an encoded `polyline` with five decimal places, which polyline decoders assume. Pass `geometries="geojson"` to get it as a GeoJSON `LineString` in `geometry` instead, which maps draw without decoding, or `geometries="polyline6"` for six decimal places.

Pass `steps=True` and each leg's `steps` has its turn-by-turn directions: an `instruction`, its distance and time, and its `lat` and `lon`. They're in English unless you pass `lang`, such as `lang="fr"`.

An isochrone is a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` with one polygon per time, largest first, so a map that draws them in order shows the smaller ones on top:

```python
area = client.routing.isochrone({"lat": 45.5189, "lon": -122.6793}, [5, 10], mode="walk")
print([feature["properties"]["minutes"] for feature in area["features"]])
```

If your app shows results, show the credits in each response's `attribution`.

## Errors and retries

An error response raises `MapricotError`, with the HTTP `status`, the API's error `code`, a `message`, and the `request_id`:

```python
from mapricot import MapricotError

try:
    client.geocoding.search("")
except MapricotError as error:
    print(error.status, error.code, error.message)  # 400 invalid_request The service rejected the request.
```

The client retries `503` responses and `429 concurrency_exceeded`, up to twice, waiting longer each time. Errors aren't billed. Set `max_retries=` and `timeout=` (seconds) on `Mapricot(...)` to change this. The [API reference](https://mapricot.com/api-reference/#errors) lists every status.
